Here's something I'd love to dive deeper into:
</p><p>
Why do we get some songs stuck in our head?
</p><p>
The book “<a href="http://sivers.org/book/MadeToStick">Made to Stick</a>” analyzed it wonderfully for stories and words.  But what about music?
</p><p>
There are some songs I haven't heard in 30 years, but I can still play them in my head on call. (<a href="http://www.sitcomsonline.com/eddiesfatherthemesong.html">example</a>)
</p><p>
Yesterday afternoon I heard the song “<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lykke+Li/_/Tonight">Tonight</a>” by Lykke Li, and this morning woke up still singing it. (Great repeating 1-bar hook with the highest note on the downbeat. Find the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Youth-Novels/dp/B001MJKUTY/?tag=cdbaby">full album version with great orchestration</a>.)
</p><p>
My old teacher <a href="http://www.berklee.edu/faculty/detail/jack-perricone">Jack Perricone</a> has some great lessons for songwriters on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/063400638X/?tag=cdbaby">writing memorable melodies</a>, but that doesn't get into <em>why</em> music sticks in our brain.
</p><p>
Books like <a href="http://sivers.org/book/BrainRules">Brain Rules</a> analyze evolutionary reasons why our brains do the things they do. (“Brains in wild animals are 15%-30% larger than tame, domestic counterparts. The cold, hard world forced the wild animals into constant learning mode. It is the same with humans.”)
</p><p>
But why music?
</p><p>
Any ideas?
