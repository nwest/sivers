<title>Read these books. </title>







<p>
At first I was going to write a long essay here about what a big difference these books have made in my life.
</p><p>
But that would be more blah-blah-blah about me, whereas <strong>books are really about you</strong>.
</p><p>
So instead, I'm just going to point you to something that will change your life.  My book list.

<strong>Read that instead of this</strong>.
