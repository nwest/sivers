<p>
If you live in a city, try growing your own fresh air.
</p><p>
See <a href="http://greenspaces.in/blog/ted09/">this video and page</a>.  It's only four minutes and very worth it.  Scroll down the page to see the details on the plants.

Since I got an apartment in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=union+square,+new+york+city&amp;sll=40.73612,-73.989487&amp;sspn=0.01317,0.027895&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.734121,-73.992233&amp;spn=0.01317,0.027895&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=E">Union Square</a>, New York City, I decided to do it.
</p><p>
I called my <a href="http://www.plantworksnyc.com/">local greenhouse</a> and asked them to order:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>4 x Areca Palm</strong> (Chrysalidocarpus lutescens) $50 each = $200</li>
<li><strong>8 x Mother-in-lawâ€™s Tongue</strong> (Sansevieria trifasciata) $40 each = $320</li>
<li><strong>4 x Money Plant</strong> (Epipremnum aureum) $30 each = $120</li>
</ul>
<p>
A total of $640 spent for clean air for the next few years.  Good deal.  The plants were delivered today (brought on a truck up from Florida), so we'll see if it makes a real difference.
</p><p>
I just wanted to post it here in case this appeals to you, too.
