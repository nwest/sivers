From 1990 to 1992 I ran the New York archives at <a href="http://www.warnerchappell.com/">Warner/Chappell Music Publishing</a>.
</p><p>
(The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_publisher_(popular_music)">music publishing business</a> gives a cash advance to a songwriter in return for owning half the income generated from their songs.  The publisher is betting that the songs will earn at least that much, whether recorded by a famous artist or the songwriter themselves.)
</p><p>
One day, as I walked by someone's desk, I noticed she had accidently left out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet">balance sheet</a> showing every songwriter signed to the New York office, their cash advance, and how much they had earned.  I quickly took it to the Xerox machine, made a copy, and put it back.
</p><p>
That night, reading it on the subway home, I learned a great lesson by looking at a huge difference between two songwriters:
</p><p>
There was one writer who was wonderful - a publisher's dream.  Her songs were great and easy to pitch to famous artists.  She turned in a new song every week, professional and well-recorded.  She was signed to Warner/Chappell because one of the managers there heard her and believed in her, even though she hadn't had any success yet.  <strong>Her advance: $15,000</strong>.
</p><p>
The other writer was horrible. His songs were really bad metal that'd make <a href="http://www.spinaltap.com/">Spinal Tap</a> cringe. Poorly recorded, terribly performed, sent late, and on reel-to-reel tape that nobody used anymore. (I always had to dust off the reel-to-reel machine twice a year when his new demos would arrive.)  But in the 80s he'd been in a band with a major rock star, and had 1/16th of a songwriting credit on one song that was on a record that sold over 20 million copies.  <strong>His advance: $500,000</strong>.
</p><p>
The lesson I never forgot:
</p><p>
<strong>You have to make your own success first, before you ask the industry for help.</strong>
</p><p>
You have to show that you're going to be successful with-or-without their help. Show that you have momentum, and if they want to accelerate it or amplify it they can, but it will cost them to ride your coat-tails.
</p><p>
If you don't do this, then even in the best-case scenario, where someone at the company really believes in you, you'll have no negotiating leverage, and will get the worst deal possible.
</p><p>
If you're just starting out, don't ask the industry for help yet.  Make something happen by yourself first, so you have a success story to tell and momentum to show.
