Being an analytical learning-addict, I can't help but distill some lessons from this “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8z7f7a2Pk">Guy Starts Dance Party</a>” video taken last week.  I'd really like to hear your thoughts, too.  First, let's watch:

<p>
You can't help but smile. First at the guy, then at the reaction. It's so fun!
</p><p>
But this is also the most obvious, instant, and visual example of <strong>how to start a movement</strong>, that books like <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/tribesbook">Tribes</a> and <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/">The Tipping Point</a> have covered so well.
</p>
<h3>For anyone interested in starting a movement, or hoping others start a movement around your company/mission/music, how can we describe what we see here?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The leader has to be doing it for his own sake - not trying to start anything.</li>
<li>He has the guts to look a little ridiculous, but not care. Most are too shy to stand out like that.</li>
<li>He's so clearly having fun that others think, “He's having more fun than me. Maybe I should join in.”</li>
<li>What he's doing is so simple, it's almost instructional. Even if you usually don't, you could do that.</li>
<li><strong>The turning point is when he gets one follower.</strong> Following the leader, and also clearly having fun doing it.</li>
<li>But maybe they're just two freaks? Hmm... better not get involved yet. Tempting, though. Wait and watch.</li>
<li>It's important that they were very public - seen by everyone. Movements need to be visible.</li>
<li><strong>Now comes the second follower.</strong> It's almost a crowd. If you were to join in now, you wouldn't be a freak. Hmm... maybe?</li>
<li><strong>The tipping point is the next two people that jump in.</strong>  Now it's a crowd!</li>
<li><strong>Three more jump in immediately. Momentum! It's a movement! No reason not to. Let's go!</strong></li>
<li>Every adventurous person in the crowd jumps in.</li>
<li>Finally, every non-adventurous person in the crowd jumps in, because they'd be ridiculed if they don't.</li>
</ul>
<h3>So if you wanted to make a movement, what lessons would you take from this?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want to be a starter, have the guts to stand out. Make your actions easy to imitate. Fun to follow. Attract attention. Show everyone what you're doing.</li>
<li>If you find a lone nut doing something great, have the guts to follow him/her. You'll also stand out, but you're serving one of the most important roles in making this a movement. Show everyone how to follow.</li>
<li>Found something cool that only a few freaks are doing? Get some friends and say, “Let's go!” Jump in.</li>
<li>(... <strong>what else?</strong> ...)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Doing something that needs followers? (In this case, the music.) Help fan the flames of this process:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shine a spotlight on the first fan that loves you. Help them be a starter. Show what they're doing, and how happy they are.</li>
<li>Help your second fan join together with the first, instead of also dancing alone.</li>
<li>Make sure they do almost exactly the same thing, so it's easy for others to also see how to join.</li>
<li>Give a few early adopters the courage to jump in together with the first. Make sure they stick together as a group.</li>
<li>Now it's not about you, it's about them. Publicize the group, not yourself. Make it fun to join.</li>
<li>Make sure all late-adopters can see what fun the early adopters are having.</li>
<li>(... <strong>what else?</strong> ...)</li>
</ul>
