<title>You have enough. </title>

I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00154JDAI">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41146122">E71</a> but you won't hear me rave about them.  I don't want you to want them.

The quickest way to double your income is to halve your expenses.  Any study of happiness will tell you it's best to actively appreciate what you've got.

I feel a responsibility with my PA system of <a href="http://sivers.org/blog">blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/sivers">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Derek_Sivers/609761260">Facebook</a> to only put helpful thoughts into the world.
</p><p>
So, no product raves here.  You already have more than you need.

At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> tells his friend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Heller">Joseph Heller</a>, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22">Catch-22</a> over its whole history.
</p><p>
Heller said, “Yes, but <strong>I have something he will never have: Enough.</strong>”
