One of the problems with being an expert at something, is <strong>you forget what it's like to not know the basics</strong>.
</p><p>
Because I like being very <a href="http://sivers.org/contact">easy to contact</a>, I get all kinds of questions about the music business and entrepreneurship.
</p><p>
Some of them are so basic, I'm almost stumped!
</p><p>
It's like someone asks you, “I've got this <strong>henhouse full of chickens, but I don't see any eggs. What should I do?</strong>”
</p><p>
<em>(Hmmm... Maybe it's a strange disease we should look into? Maybe the chickens are over 3 years old? Maybe it's temperature?)</em>
</p><p>
Before getting complicated, you dare to ask the obvious, “Uh... <strong>have you looked under the chickens?</strong>”
</p><p>
“[pause] ... <strong>Hey! There they are!</strong> Wow! I never thought of that! Thanks so much!”
</p><p>
Computer technicians, plumbers and doctors must have this more than anyone.
</p><p>
I like getting these questions, though.  They're a good reminder of beginner's mind.  I try to remember all the questions I must have asked when I was just getting started.
