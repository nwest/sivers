Any creator of anything knows this feeling:
</p>
<p>
You experience someone else's innovative work.
It's beautiful, brilliant, breath-taking.
You're stunned.
</p>
<p>
Their ideas are unexpected and surprising, but perfect.
</p>
<p>
You think, “<strong>I never would have thought of that.
How do they even come up with that?
It's genius!</strong>”
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, you think, “My ideas are so obvious.
I'll never be as inventive as that.”
</p>
<p>
I get this feeling often.
Amazing <a href="http://sivers.org/book/Sum">books</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_string_quartets_by_B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k">music</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away">movies</a>, or even amazing <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/SethGodinonDVD">conversations</a>.
I'm in awe at how the creator thinks like that.
I'm humbled.
</p>
<p>
But I continue to do my work.
I tell my little tales.
I share my point of view.
Nothing spectacular.
Just my ordinary <a href="http://sivers.org/blog">thoughts</a>.
</p>
<p>
One day someone emailed me and said, “I never would have thought of that.
How did you even come up with that?
It's genius!”
</p>
<p>
Of course I disagreed, and explained why it was nothing special.
</p>
<p>
But afterwards, I realized something surprisingly profound:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Everybody's ideas seem obvious to them.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I'll bet even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kotK9FNEYU">John Coltrane</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr8sVailoLw">Richard Feynman</a> felt that everything they were playing or saying was pretty obvious.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So maybe what's obvious to me is amazing to someone else?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hit songwriters, in interviews, often admit that their most successful hit song was one they thought was just stupid, even not worth recording.
</p>
<p>
We're clearly a bad judge of our own creations.
We should just put it out and let the world decide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are you holding back something that seems too obvious to share?</strong>
