I want to accelerate change.  ALL change, even “bad”.
</p><p>
I put “bad” in quotes, because that's what others call it, though I don't believe you can <a href="http://sivers.org/horses">call a fact bad or good</a>.
</p><p>
Why do I want even “bad” change?  Because it's a challenge.  And I'm one confident mofo.  I can handle ANYthing the world throws my way.  So bring it on!
</p><p>
Accelerating change is a time machine.  Let's get the future here faster.  Change is good training.
</p><p>
There's opportunity in everything.  If it's something that most people see as a “bad” change, then discovering its benefit is even more fun.
</p><p>
Cut off my legs, and I'll still find a way to <a href="http://sivers.org/aimee-mullins">run</a>.
