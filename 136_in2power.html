<title>Me, we. </title>







<p>
My favorite movies are the ones <strong>where the humble main character realizes how powerful they really are, then accepts that responsibility for the greater good, even though it would be easier to keep denying it</strong>.  See the ending of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/">Spirited Away</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/">The Godfather I</a>, or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>.  (Any others like that?)

I had that moment myself, yesterday.
</p><p>
For the last two years, I've been avoiding all responsibility.  I gave away everything.  Sold my house, car, and company.  Roamed around the world with only a little backpack.  Lots of learning, reading, thinking, and writing, but not a lot of doing.
</p><p>
I posted all of <a href="http://sivers.org/">my projects at sivers.org</a>, but was in no rush to make them happen.
</p><p>
When people asked what I do, I'd say, “Not much.”  (When <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/">Seth Godin</a> heard me say this, he said one should never spread ennui. That hit me.)
</p><p>
Then yesterday, as I was <a href="http://sivers.org/ideas2">writing about ideas</a>, I mentioned <strong>something I've always known would be incredibly powerful, but was just denying the responsibility to make it happen</strong>.
</p><p>
I always say “<a href="http://sivers.org/scares-excites-do-it">whatever scares you, go do it</a>”, so here we go...
</p><p>
I've started an incubator company called <a href="http://nownownow.com/">Now Now Now</a>, where I <strong>develop each of my ideas for services that can benefit musicians</strong>, and:
<ul>
<li>set the plan, direction, and goals</li>
<li>fund it and own it</li>
<li>hire people to build and manage it</li>
<li>then just oversee it and guide it.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<strong>This is a HUGE challenge to me: To resist the temptation to do everything myself. To be a great leader</strong> of an entire team of people that's dedicated to helping musicians. To really use and learn the lessons from some great books on business leadership:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sivers.org/book/Execution">Execution</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sivers.org/book/EMythRevisited">E-Myth</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sivers.org/book/KnowHow">Know-How</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sivers.org/book/UltimateSalesMachine">Ultimate Sales Machine</a></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
I've always known that doing things this way would be infinitely more powerful than casually doing everything myself.  I just didn't want the reponsibility.  Now I do.
</p><p>
More news about this, soon.
