<p>If you're also going to any of these, please email me at <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">derek@sivers.org</a>.  I tend to be a social butterfly at these things, so instead of scheduled meetings, I prefer to just talk in the halls when we're both free.  I'm usually pretty easy to find, and will be checking email and <a href="http://twitter.com/sivers">Twitter</a> for meetups.</p>

<dt><a href="http://www.midem.com/">MIDEM</a> - January 16-21 in Cannes, France</dt>
<dd>I've been to MIDEM once before a few years ago and didn't like it. Full of old suits, talking “product” and “content”. Too disconnected from musicians. But I'm going again to give it another shot. No agenda - just open eyes and ears, there to learn, and get to know people.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://smithsonian20.si.edu/">Smithsonian 2.0</a> - January 23-24 in Washington DC</dt>
<dd>I'm on the advisory board of Smithsonian/Folkways, and this is “A Gathering to Re-Imagine the Smithsonian in the Digital Age.”  Sorry it's a closed event, but if there's something you want me to bring up there, please let me know.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> - February 3-7 in Long Beach, California</dt>
<dd>Going to TED is a dream of mine. It sells out fast, it's crazy expensive, and you need to apply with references like 10 months in advance. So 11 months ago, I did. And I'm so psyched to go. Watch videos of past talks at ted.com</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/events/dcpolicyday09/">Future Of Music</a> - February 11-12 in Washington DC</dt>
<dd>I'm on the Board of Directors for this great organization that is constantly working on policy change to help musicians earn a living. I highly recommend anyone interested in musicians' issues in the courts, Congress, FCC, or Copyright office attend this one-day Policy Day event on Feb 11.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.folkalliance.org/">Folk Alliance</a> - February 18-22 in Memphis Tennessee</dt>
<dd>I love Folk Alliance. This is like no other conference. There are hundreds of showcases, because the event takes over many full floors of the hotel, with musicians playing in every room. Yes, in the little hotel rooms. You sit on the bed or squat on the floor and listen to amazing musicians in the most intimate environment. It's such a friendly environment and everyone is so approachable, including many booking agents, venue owners, radio DJs, and anyone connected to the folk music industry.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://en.oreilly.com/et2009/">ETech</a> - March 9-12 in San Jose California</dt>
<dd>Not music, just geeky tech. I've had friends rave about this for years, so I'm going for the first time.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">South by Southwest</a> - March 13-22 in Austin Texas</dt>
<dd>Yep: 10 whole days of meeting people in Austin. Daunting. Overwhelming. Love/Hate. I haven't been in a few years, so I'm going to go with an open mind, meet a ton of people, and report back on everything here, sharing everything I learn.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.ascap.com/eventsawards/events/expo/">ASCAP Expo</a> - April 23-25 in Los Angeles</dt>
<dd>I went for the first time last year, and was really impressed. Good panels, good exhibitors, good location. I can wholeheartedly recommend this one.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.musexpo.net/09/">MUSEXPO</a> - April 26-29 in Los Angeles</dt>
<dd>An all-around great conference especially because it has such an international focus. A great balance of industry and artists (not too many of either). Many from Australia, Scandinavia, UK. I can wholeheartedly recommend this one, too.  Doing both ASCAP and MUSEXPO in one trip would be 6 days well-spent.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/pages/view/id/207">TED Global</a> - July 21-24 in Oxford England</dt>
<dd>Already explained I'm psyched about TED, so I want more more more!  As a kid, I used to live in Abingdon, the next town over, so I'll get to go see my old childhood house.</dd>
