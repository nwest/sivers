<title>Don't... if you think it's going to make you happy </title>







<p>
I'm thinking of moving to India for 6 months.
</p><p>
I called my friend <a href="http://thinksimplenow.com/">Tina Su</a> to discuss it.  We talked about pros and cons.
</p><p>
In the end, I asked, “<strong>Is there any reason NOT to go?</strong>”
</p><p>
She thought deeply then said, “Yes. <strong>Don't go if you think it's going to make you happy.</strong>”
</p><p>
Brilliant.
