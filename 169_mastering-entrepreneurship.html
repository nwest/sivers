After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743277465">The Art of Learning</a>, I was thinking of mastery : committing yourself to years of achieving mastery of one single thing.
</p><p>
My first thought was computer programming, but that didn't feel fulfilling enough. I enjoy it, but only as a means to a different goal.
</p><p>
Then I realized <strong>the thing I could really commit myself to a lifetime pursuit of mastery is entrepreneurship</strong>.  It satisfies me on every level - much more for personal and altruistic reasons than financial.
</p><p>
But - <strong>what the hell is mastery of entrepreneurship?</strong>  Starting one successful company?  Ten?  Or is it something else entirely?  There's no championship, no finish line, especially since happiness is a crucial barometer.
</p><p>
And if entrepreneurship is about creating a new company, then focusing on that means starting a company, getting it to proof of success, but not getting involved with ongoing management, since management is a different skill.  The focused entrepreneur should then start a new company.
</p><p>
The Art of Learning talks a lot about mastering the simple skills one at a time (“<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aAYcmC-_sM8C&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=making.smaller.circles&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3KpWzxbB13&amp;sig=OgvGGSac8lvFH4XCnAN_cGyi5D8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result">making smaller circles</a>”).  
</p><p>
In his chess examples, he would spend weeks competing with his teacher with only 2 pieces on the board, to thoroughly understand strategy with just those 2 pieces.
</p><p>
In his Tai Chi examples, he would spend hours a day for days or weeks on end, just doing one simple arm extension.
</p><p>
But <strong>what are the building block ingredients to entrepreneurship?</strong>  Coming up with ideas?  Turning rough ideas into a specific written plan?  Turning plans into a working system and specific goals?  Working with people to ensure those goals are met?
</p><p>
Sorry I'm all questions and no answers today, but I'm really curious to hear your thoughts.  Please leave any thoughts in the comment box, below.  Thanks!
