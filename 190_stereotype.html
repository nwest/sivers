<title>I'm a stereotypical entrepreneur </title>







<p>
It seems I'm a ridiculous walking stereotype of an entrepreneur. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship">Wikipedia page about entrepreneurship</a> says entrepreneurs are...
<ul>
<li>mercurial, that is, prone to insights, brainstorms, deceptions, ingeniousness and resourcefulness. cunning, opportunistic, creative, and unsentimental</li>
<li>extremely optimistic in their decision-making processes</li>
<li>prone to overconfidence and over generalisations</li>
<li>tough, pragmatic people driven by needs of independence and achievement. They seldom are willing to submit to authority.</li>
<li>primarily motivated by an overwhelming need for achievement and strong urge to build</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Like one of those astrology or cultural moments where some generalization actually describes you exactly, I've realized I'm a type.  A total stereotype.  Oh well.</p>
<p>
Oh and just to rub it in, I was born in Silicon Valley, California.  Sheesh.
