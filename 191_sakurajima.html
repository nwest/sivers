The southern-most big island in Japan is Kyushu.  At the southern tip of that is a city called Kagoshima, which overlooks a huge active volcano in the water called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakurajima">Sakurajima</a>, accessible by a 15-minute ferry ride.

One road leads around the base of the volcano.  At the southern-most part of the volcano is a hot springs, right on the ocean, with a little hotel called Furusato Kanko.  And that's where I've been the last couple days, soaking in the mineral water, right where that guy is in the photo, below.  (Just 10 feet behind the camera is the Pacific ocean.)<br />

Of course I'm SO relaxed now, that I'm DONE relaxing, and damn ready to start a new business to help musicians.  But more on that later.  For now I just had to post an “I am here” as a bookmark reminder of one of the most amazing places I've ever been.
