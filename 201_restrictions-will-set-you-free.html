A great book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0877736103/cdbaby">The Listening Book</a> had this wonderful quote:
</p><p>
<strong>Restrictions will set you free</strong>
</p><p>
Example:
</p><p>
Someone says, "Write me a piece of music. Anything. No restrictions. Go!"
</p><p>
You're stumped.  The blank page syndrome.
</p><p>
Instead, someone says, "Write me a piece of music using only a flute, saw, and this broken toy piano.  You can only use the notes D, E, and B - but never all 3 at the same time.  It has to be in 3/4 time, start quiet, get loud, then get quiet by the end.  Go!"
</p><p>
Aha!  Now you're cookin'!
