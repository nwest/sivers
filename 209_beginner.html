Ah, it's great to be a beginner again.
</p><p>
I'm starting some new companies to help musicians.  Getting back to the core of what I love doing : helping my fellow musicians in ways that big companies don't find worth it.
</p><p>
I'm learning piano - boogie piano, specifically, but I have to start with just doing my scale fingerings that I haven't practiced in 18 years.
</p><p>
Great contrast from the complexity of running a company with 85 employees and 200,000 clients.  Just practicing my scales with a metronome.
</p><p>
I sold my house, furnished!  Now everything I own fits in my car.  Once I read my queue of 50 books and give them to friends, everything I own should fit in 2 suitcases.
</p><p>
It's fun to be back at square one.
</p><p>
Confidence is needed to shake off previous expertise.
</p><p>
Excitement comes from being in over your head.
</p><p>
Next comes Mandarin and surfing lessons.
