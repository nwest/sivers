<p>Just got an email from a high school student asking if I would recommend Berklee College of Music, as compared to taking a year off to travel the world.</p>
<p>After giving some details about Berklee, I realized it came down to this:</p>
<p><strong>I have some easy rule-of-thumbs to follow</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>whatever excites you, go do it</strong></li>
<li><strong>whatever scares you, go do it</strong></li>
<li>every time you're making a choice, one choice is the safe/comfortable choice - and one choice is the risky/uncomfortable choice.   the risky/uncomfortable choice is the one that will teach you the most and make you grow the most, so that's the one you should choose.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if travelling Europe as a vagabond for a year is what seems more scary and exciting, do that! Though if that feels like slacking or avoiding, and going to music school is more scary and exciting, do that!</p>
<p>The risk/safety choice thing comes from Abraham Maslow, and you should see <a href="http://psikoloji.fisek.com.tr/maslow/self.htm">this page about Abraham Maslow's theory of self-actualization</a> if you're interested in that kinda thing.</p>
<p>My friend Mark Fried of Spirit Music had a similar saying: “<strong>Whatever you're thinking, go do it.</strong>” - which I also seem to follow almost every day.</p>
