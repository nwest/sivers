If everyone is famous for 15 minutes, we need to learn a quick lesson in celebrity : the public you is not you.
</p><p>
Over the summer, I rewrote the CD Baby software.&nbsp; I learned some programming lessons along the way, so I felt a kind of social obligation to share my lessons learned, to help a future person in a similar situation.
</p><p>
It took 90 minutes or so to write out my explanation of the situation and lessons learned, then I posted it on my (other) blog, not thinking many people would see it, read it, or care.
</p><p>
The next day I found out that many of the top programmer-focused websites had linked to my story with a sensationalist headline.&nbsp; Hundreds of people screamed their anger in the <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html">blog comments</a>, calling me an idiot, saying my website sucks, the world is crap because of people like me, any warthog could have programmed my site in a tenth of the time without opposable thumbs, etc.
</p><p>
It reminded me of the times in the past when I've posted things on the <a href="http://cdbaby.org/">CD Baby message board</a> that got hundreds of people calling me a genius, saying my website rules, the world is great because of people like me, and nobody else on earth could have done the brilliant things I've done.
</p><p>
In both cases, people are talking about the public version of me, not the real me.
</p><p>
Neither one should be taken personally.&nbsp; (Unless you're feeling down, then go read the compliments and taken them very personally, temporarily, to get back in gear.)
</p><p>
For musicians, it's especially important to remember this, since your music is not you, but just something you've done.
</p><p>
Some easy ways to practice this mindset:
</p><ul>
<li>
Put your songs out there for anonymous critique.&nbsp; &nbsp;garageband.com used to do this, though I don't know who else is, now. Anyone?
</li>
<li>
Put your songs out for non-anonymous critique, and realize it's the same as anonymous.&nbsp; They never were critiquing you, just the notes, words, and recording quality.
</li>
<li>
Publicly say something controversial.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder if the Dixie Chicks were able to remember that none of the uproar was about them, as people?
</li>
</ul>
