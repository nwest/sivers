When I'm posting about something that's technical-geek-programmer talk, I'm going to keep it on the O'Reilly blog, instead of here.

So - here's a story I just posted about why we kept CD Baby in PHP instead of switching it over to Rails, called <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html">7 reasons I switched back to PHP after 2 years on Rails</a>.

Only of interest to other programmers.
