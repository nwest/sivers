<p>
Stay in over your head.
</p><p>
Whatever you're doing in your life right now, if it's become a routine, it's time to move on to something new and scary.

Abraham Maslow wrote, “Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) and risk (for the sake of progress and growth): <strong>Make the growth choice a dozen times a day</strong>.”

Whatever scares you, go do it.
