Your website can be your best tool, if you make it communicate with your fans and potential fans, TWO-WAY.
</p>
<p>
Your website should get people involved, make them want to introduce themselves, ask questions, shout out.
</p>
<p>
YOUR WEBSITE SHOULD:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Get their email address!  Interact!  Make an easy fill-out form.  (hint: try a fun question like “who are you?” or “do you know your own name?”)
</li>
<li>
Encourage them to buy your CD, constantly.  It's a great way to start a relationship.
</li>
<li>
Show what's unique about you.  Image, quirks, colors, moods.
</li>
<li>
Make the sound clips easy to get to, not buried under layers
</li>
<li>
Answer the obvious questions: who are you, what do you look like, let me hear the music
</li>
<li>
Acknowledge them! Have their pictures on your site. Answer their questions on your site. Show them they ARE a part of your life.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And make sure you have your own domain name.
