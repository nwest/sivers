The self-promoting musician of the past needed to always have a presskit (with CD and photo) nearby and ready to send.
</p>
<p>
The modern self-promoting musician needs to keep a “PROMO BOX” folder on the desktop of your computer.
</p>
<p>
It will take you just one hour to put together, and you'll be able to use it again and again and again:
</p>
<p>
Make a folder on your desktop called “promo box” and put these things inside for quick easy access:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. At least one full-length MP3 file of a track from your CD.</strong>  Encoded at the standard 128k bitrate. Give it a nice long name, without spaces, so that if anyone runs across it on the web they know who it is.  (Example:   RACHAEL_SAGE-sistersong.mp3 )  Preferably have 3-5 songs from your CD encoded here, ready to go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. An entertaining bio written four times, in four different lengths.</strong><br />
- Long long version (over 3 paragraphs.  1-2 pages.  exhaustive and rarely used.)<br />
- Medium long version (2 - 4 entertaining and important paragraphs.  the top end of what people will sit and read on the web.)<br />
- Short version ( 1 killer paragraph)<br />
- One-liner   ( 1 killer sentence )
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.  Quotes from reviews:</strong>  <br />
- one big text file with every review you've ever gotten, all typed out and credited<br />
- one text file with just the best short quotes from these reviews
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.  Graphics, with a few different sizes of each:</strong><br />
- artist photos  (studio shot, live shot, up close, far away)<br />
- album cover graphic  (big version, small version)<br />
- your logo, if you have one
</p>
<p>
IF YOU DO THIS, JUST ONCE, then the job of uploading your information to another website will be painless.  You'll just say, “da-da-da!  all done!”  and let your MP3s upload while you go make dinner.
