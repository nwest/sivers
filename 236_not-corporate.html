<title>Have fun - do NOT be corporate </title>







<p>
Never use corporate marketing-speak.
</p>
<p>
Be weird.
</p>
<p>
Be a real person.
</p>
<p>
Sound like one person speaking to one person.
</p>
<p>
This is a big reason why it's COOL to be indie instead of corporate.
</p>
<p>
Real people respond better to the weird fun stuff.
