When asked, most musicians say, “We don't sound like anyone.”  Or when asked what kind of music they play, say, “You can't describe it.  Just check it out.”
</p>
<p>
That's <strong>a lazy, inconsiderate, stupid mistake</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Think of it from the other person's point of view: Imagine you saw someone with a business card that said, “President -  Some Company, Inc.”  You say, “What kind of business do you do?” - and they say, “Oh, I don't know. It's not like anything. I can't describe it.  You'll just have to check it out!  We're about 20 minutes down that road, and we're only open next Thursday from 11 to 12 at night.”
</p>
<p>
Would you really get in your car and spend a Thursday night to check it out, if <strong>they couldn't even tell you WHY you should?  No!</strong>
</p>
<p>
You have to convince people!  Grab their curiosity.  Describe what you actually do, in an interesting way.
</p>
<p>
Make the wheels in their head turn.  Make them taste it, hear it, see it, want it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Anyone who asks what kind of music you do is giving you a chance to impress them</strong>.  Take the opportunity.
