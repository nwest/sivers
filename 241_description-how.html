How do you come up with one good phrase to describe your music?  Here are some ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Email everyone you know (especially your fans), saying you're trying to come up with a single phrase to describe your music, and ask their help.  Maybe make it a contest.
</li>
<li>
Notice what's most unique about you.  Do your songs have a recurring theme?  Unusual instrumentation?
</li>
<li>
Find a few 14-year-old kids, and treat them to pizza if they'll sit and listen to a few songs, and describe it for you while waiting for the pizza to arrive.
</li>
<li>
Read a music magazine that's describing other people's music you've never heard before.  Notice which phrases make YOU curious to hear more.
</li>
<li>
Offer to pay a music writer to help you.  This is what they do for a living.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you've got one you like, start trying it out on people.  Watch their face.  See if it lights-up.  See if they get curious.
</p>
<p>
When you've got a great one, you'll know it.  Use it for years and years.
