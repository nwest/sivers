<p>
Did you ever see the movie “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105151/">The Player</a>”?
</p>
<p>
Hundreds of screenwriters in Hollywood are pitching their movie ideas to the studio executive.  Each one has about 5 seconds to impress him.  The ONE sentence they use to describe their story decides whether the studio will read it or not.
</p>
<p>
You need to come up with one good sentence to describe your music. It has one goal : <strong>MAKE PEOPLE CURIOUS</strong>.
</p>
<p>
It should not try to describe every note of music you'll ever make.  It should not try to justify your existence on Earth.  It only has to <strong>describe your music just-enough to make people curious to hear it</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I described my band as “a cross between James Brown and the Beatles”.  Of course not everything I did sounded exactly like that, but that phrase was just-enough to make hundreds of people want to hear more.  I would see it work, every day, as I told it to people.  You'd <strong>watch their eyes look up, watch their face change as they tried to imagine</strong> a cross between James Brown and the Beatles.  Then they'd say, “Wow - I have to hear this!”.  And that's all I wanted.
</p>
<p>
The shorter, the better.  Give them one good sentence (a few good words), and stop talking.  Let them imagine the rest.
