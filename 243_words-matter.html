<title>Why words matter more than ever </title>







<p>
<strong>On the radio, your music speaks for itself.</strong>  People hear your music and decide if they like it.  No words were needed to describe it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In concert, your music speaks for itself.</strong>  Watching you perform, people appreciate your style as an artist.  No words necessary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>But on the internet, and in print, and in conversation, words matter a LOT.</strong>
</p>
<p>
When people have not yet heard your music, your <strong>words describing your music</strong> have to be SO good that it makes people go to the trouble of hearing your music.
</p>
<p>
Online, the words need to <strong>make them go click the links</strong> to hear it (and buy it).
</p>
<p>
In print-media, the words need to <strong>make them put down the magazine</strong> and go find a way to hear you.
</p>
<p>
In conversation, the words need to <strong>make them remember</strong> enough to go hear you later.
</p>
<p>
It's a BIG job, but since <strong>these are the ways you're going to call attention to your music</strong> (until you're on every radio/TV outlet in the world), you need to <strong>learn how to describe your music</strong>.  It's not that hard, and it's VERY important.
