Don't be afraid to ask for favors.
</p>
<p>
Some people LIKE doing favors.
</p>
<p>
It's like asking for directions in New York City.  People's egos get stroked when they know the answer to something you're asking.  They'll gladly answer to show off their knowledge.
</p>
<p>
One bold musician I know called me up one day and said, “I'm coming to New York in 2 months.  Can you give me a list of all the important contacts you think I should meet?”  What guts!  But I laughed, and did a search in my database, emailing him a list of 40 people he should call, and mention my name.

Sometimes you need to find something specific: a video director for cheap, a PA system you can borrow for a month, a free rehearsal studio.  Call up everyone you know and ask!  This network of friends you are creating will have everything you want in life.
</p>
<p>
Some rare and lucky folks (perhaps on your “band mailing list”) have time on their hands and would rather help you do something, than sit at home in front of the TV another night.   Need help doing flyers?   Help getting equipment to a show?  Go ahead and ask!<br />
