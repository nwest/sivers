<p>
Some people, out of the thousands I know, actually contact me on a regular basis. I consider them friends.
</p>
<p>
But some of those always stick with a strict business “script” when they call:  “Hi I'm calling to check in to see how sales are doing, if you need more inventory, how things are going.”
</p>
<p>
Others seem to have the gift of smalltalk.  I don't know how they do it, but soon we're talking about my girlfriend,  their dogs, about yoga, high school, Japan, and something that happened on the way to work today.
</p>
<p>
Now - <strong>when an opportunity comes up to help someone</strong> - (say, a Film/TV person I know calls up and asks “who's good in that standard rock genre?”) - <strong>guess who comes to mind first?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The person who hasn't departed from the standard business call, or the person who went beyond?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Be a real person.  Be a friend.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Don't always be selling yourself.</strong>  You'll be like that annoying uncle who shows up at the family reunion to try to sell everyone on life insurance.
</p>
<p>
Have the confidence to know that being a cool person, being a friend, will sell you more than being a pushy salesperson.
</p>
<p>
<strong>People do business with people they like.  With their friends, whenever possible.</strong>
