One of the best books about the music business was called “Making It in the New Music Business” by James Riordan.
</p>
<p>
He suggested that, as an aspiring musician (or producer/agent/writer/etc.) - you make a point to <strong>meet three new people in the music industry every week</strong>.  (And, as he says, not just burned-out guitarists.)
</p>
<p>
Imagine that!  Three new people every single week - people that could actually help your career!  In a year from now you'll have relationships with over 150 new people that are potential “lottery tickets” - and hopefully the interest is mutual.  (Meaning - always keep in mind how YOU can help someone, not just how they can help you.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>The thing is, you have to *develop* these relationships.</strong>  Put them on your A, B, or C list.  Stay in touch.  Go beyond the introduction, and really get to know these people, what they're looking for in business and life, what they're interested in, and how you can help them.<br />
