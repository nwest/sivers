When you see a room full of people, make sure you are not thinking like a mosquito, looking at them as something to suck dry, to get what you want and move on.
</p><p>
It's important to meet people, but more important to really get to know them.  Ask questions.  Listen.  Make a point of <strong>discovering what you can do for them</strong>.
</p><p>
The best opportunities will come from real friends, not “contacts”.  Be a good friend.  Relax.  Don't be a mosquito.
