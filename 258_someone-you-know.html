<strong>Everything great that happens in your career always starts with someone you know.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Don't think that the big opportunities are somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
You don't need to surf the 'net.  Your next big break will not come from a some mysterious technology, or discovery of new information.
</p>
<p>
Your next big break will come from someone you know.
</p>
<p>
Go <strong>know</strong> people.
