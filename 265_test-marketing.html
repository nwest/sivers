In this indie music world, the best thing you can do is think in terms of “Test Marketing.”
</p>
<p>
This is what food companies do before they release a new product.  They release it just in Denver (for example), and see what people think of it there. They get feedback. They try a different name.  They try an improved flavor, based on complaints or compliments. They try a different ad campaign.  They see what works.  Constantly improving.
</p>
<p>
When it's a huge success in Denver, they know they're on to something good. They can now release it in Portland, Dallas, and Pittsburgh.  Do the same thing.
</p>
<p>
When everyone seems to like it, they get the financial backing to “roll it out” and confidently spend a ton of money to distribute it around the whole country, or the whole world.  The people investing money into it are confident, because it was a huge success in all the test markets.
</p>
<p>
Think of what you're doing with your music as test marketing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When you're a huge success on a lower level, or in a small area, THEN you can go to the big companies and ask for financial or resource help</strong> to “roll it out” to the country or world.
</p>
<p>
Then they'll feel confident that their big money is being well invested.
