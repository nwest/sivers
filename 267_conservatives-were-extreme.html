<p>
Think of the legendary performers in that conservative style.  (The ones even your grandmother could like.)
</p>
<p>
Frank Sinatra. Charlie Chaplin. Liberace. Liza Minelli. Barbara Streisand.
</p>
<p>
Even the most conservative “legendary” performers were rather extreme characters.

Don't be afraid to be as extreme as you can imagine. Being in the spotlight is the excuse.  You can get away with anything, all in the name of entertainment.
