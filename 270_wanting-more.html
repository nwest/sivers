<p>
What's more appealing?
</p>
<p>
Someone holding a carrot in front of your face, then pull it back towards them slowly?
</p>
<p>
Or someone shoving 50 carrots in your mouth?
</p>
<p>
Brian Eno (my favorite theorist) says the best thing you can do is to <strong>bring people to the point where they start searching.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not so plain or obvious that there's nothing left to the imagination.  Not so cryptic that they give up.
</p>
<p>
Give people just enough to pull them in, but make them want more.  Make them go searching for clues, or details, or explanations, or “more of what you just gave me.”
