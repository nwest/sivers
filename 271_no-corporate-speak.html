<title>Never use corporate-speak </title>







<p>
Don't try to sound pro or use industry catch phrases.
</p>
<p>
Would you do that to a friend?
</p>
<p>
Your fans are your friends.  Speak to them like real people.
</p>
<p>
Write every letter or email as if it were to a good friend.  From you to your best friend Beth.
</p>
<p>
Even if it's going out to 10,000 people.
