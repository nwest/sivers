<strong>The more senses you touch in someone, the more they'll remember you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
BEST:  a live show, with you sweating right on top of someone, the PA system pounding their chest, the smell of the smoky club, the flashing lights and live-in-person performance.
</p>
<p>
WORST:  an email.  a single web page.  a review in a magazine with no photo.
</p>
<p>
(Let's say that “emotions” are one of the senses.)
</p>
<p>
Whenever possible, try to reach as many senses as possible.  Have an amazing photo of yourself or your band, and convince every reviewer to put that photo next to the review of your album.
</p>
<p>
Send videos with your presskit. Play live shows often. Understand the power of radio to make people hear your music instead of just hearing about it.
</p>
<p>
Get onto any TV shows you can.  Scent your album with patchouli oil.  Make your songs and productions truly emotional instead of merely catchy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(Touching their emotions is like touching their body. If you do it, you'll be remembered.)</strong>
