On CD Baby, there is a great musician who made an amazing heavy-progressive-metal record.
</p>
<p>
When we had a “search keywords” section, asking for three artists he sounds like, he wrote, “britney spears, ricky martin, jennifer lopez, backstreet boys, mp3, sex, free”
</p>
<p>
What the hell was he thinking?  He just wanted to turn up in people's search engines, at any cost.
</p>
<p>
But for what?  And who?
</p>
<p>
Did he really want a Britney Spears fan to get “tricked” into finding his dark-progressive-metal record?  Would that 13-year-old girl actually spend the 25 minutes to download his 10 minute epic, “Confusing Mysteries of Hell”?  If she did, would she buy his CD?
</p>
<p>
I suggested he instead <strong>have the confidence to target the REAL fans of his music.</strong>
</p>
<p>
He put three semi-obscure progressive artists into his search engine description instead, and guess what?
</p>
<p>
He's selling more CDs than ever!  He found his true fans.
