Let's say you've decided that your style of music should be proudly called “powerpop”.
</p>
<p>
If you say, “We're powerpop!” in the very first sentence or paragraph all of your marketing.<br />
If your email address is “powerpop@yahoo.com”<br />
If your album title is “Powerpop Drip and Drop”<br />
If the license plate on your band van is “POWRPOP”
</p>
<p>
Well then... when someone comes into my record store and says they like powerpop, guess who I'm going to tell them to buy?

<strong>Have the confidence to find your niche, define who you are, then declare it again and again and again and again.</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you do it persistently enough, you will OWN that niche.  People will not be able to imagine that niche without you.
</p>
<p>
(You can try to make your own, if you're brave.  You might be “the best techno-opera artist in the world”.)
