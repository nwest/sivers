<title>The Most Expensive Vodka </title>







<p>
There is a vodka company that advertises itself as The Most Expensive Vodka You Can Buy.
</p>
<p>
I'll bet they're very successful with it.  It's almost a dare.  (And it proudly excludes people!)
</p>
<p>
Other companies are all trying to find ways to be the cheapest, and someone had the guts to decide that they were going to do exactly the opposite of everyone else.
</p>
<p>
There are some people who read the Billboard charts, and try to imitate the current trends and styles.
</p>
<p>
I suggest, even as an experiment, strongly declaring that you are something totally UN-trendy - the opposite from what everyone else wants or is trying to be.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you could advertise your live show as, “The most boring concert you'll ever see.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you want to call your music, “The most un-catchy, difficult to remember, un-danceable music you've ever heard.”
</p>
<p>
Or tell the music industry, “This music has no hit potential whatsoever.”
</p>
<p>
I'll bet you get their attention.
</p>
<p>
It's almost a dare.
