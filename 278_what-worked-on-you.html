<title>Read about new music.  Use the tricks that worked on you. </title>







<p>
Go get a music magazine that writes about new music.
</p>
<p>
You'll read about (and see pictures of) dozens of artists who you've never heard of before.
</p>
<p>
Out of that whole magazine, only one or two will really catch your attention.
</p>
<p>
WHY?
</p>
<p>
I don't have the answer.  Only you do.  Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your attention.
</p>
<p>
(Was it something about the opening sentence?  Was it a curious tidbit about the background of the singer?  What was it exactly that intrigued you?)
</p>
<p>
Analyze that.  Use that.  Adapt those techniques to try writing a headline or article about your music.
