Have you had some success at a music conference?
</p><p>
Could you distill a lesson from that success that you could share as advice to other musicians in under 2 minutes?
</p><p>
I'm doing a keynote-style one-hour talk at the <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/music">South by Southwest Music Conference</a> in three weeks, and I'd like to include you, if so.
</p><p>
The subject is <strong>practical advice on how to get the most out of the conference.  Similar to <a href="http://sivers.org/conferences">this article</a>.</strong> (Please read that link first.)
</p><p>
During my talk, I'm going to feature <strong>videos of advice from my musician/music-biz friends</strong>.  I thought it'd be nice to share the exposure, and good for the audience to hear many different opinions.
</p><p>
So if you have some short advice from experience, please:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Compose your thoughts to deliver it succinctly, <strong>between 20 seconds and 2 minutes</strong>. The shorter the better. Base it on fact, not opinion. Tell about your specific success at a conference, and the shareable lesson learned from it.</li>
<li><strong>Record a video</strong> of you speaking this advice. (Audio quality is crucial! Avoid room reverb.)</li>
<li><strong>Upload the video</strong> in the highest quality possible to <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/">vimeo.com</a></li>
<li><strong>Email me the URL</strong> to your video when uploaded</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>I'll use the best ones in my keynote speech, displayed on the big screen to the audience, with your name and URL in a big font</strong>.
</p><p>
Feel free to email me the text of your advice first, if you want feedback before bothering to record and upload a video.
</p><p>
I'll reply back to every email, to let you know if I can use it or not.
</p><p>
<strong>VIDEO DEADLINE: NEXT WEEKEND: Sunday March 7</strong>, 2010.
</p><p>
(Of course the earlier the better, so if I can't use it, there's time to tell you why, if you want to re-do it.)
