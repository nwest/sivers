Anyone want some fame being a leadership philosopher?
</p><p>
Last week I gave a 3-minute talk at the <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2010/">TED Conference</a> called “<a href="http://sivers.org/ff">How to Make a Movement - Leadership Lessons from Dancing Guy</a>”.
</p><p>
I expected nothing, but it got a standing ovation.  Peter Gabriel came up to me afterwards and said it was “funny, profound, and important.”
</p><p>
It was twittered and blogged about by <a href="http://twitter.com/tonyrobbins/status/9051718581">Tony Robbins</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/8965575435">Jason Fried</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/loic/statuses/8910545875">Loic Le Meur</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Bill_Gross/statuses/8910773300">Bill Gross</a>, and over 1000 other people.
</p><p>
Some powerful people have told me the ”First Follower” is a hit idea - that I should develop it and turn it into a book or a series of talks - the next Tipping Point, Purple Cow, etc.
</p><p>
Only problem is: I don't want to.
</p><p>
I don't want to drop my other projects to dive into this subject, even though it seems it would be successful.  I don't have any special insights.  I've said all I have to say about it.
</p><p>
So although it's usually understood that ideas are up for grabs, I should state it clearly:
</p><p>
<strong>If this “<a href="http://sivers.org/ff">First Follower</a>” idea inspires you to elaborate on it, please do.  Feel free to write a hit book about it, tour the corporate speaking circuit talking about it, or anything else.  I won't.</strong>
</p><p>
You don't have to ask my permission, pay me, or even credit me.
</p><p>
I've been very lucky with lots of opportunities.  This one's all yours.
