<p>I loved <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh MacLeod</a>'s “<a href="http://sivers.org/book/IgnoreEverybody">Ignore Everybody</a>” book, but I wanted to see what my musician friends thought of it.  <a href="http://www.alexkrupp.com/">Alex Krupp</a> had some extra copies from <a href="http://www.swagapalooza.com/">Swagapalooza</a>, which I promised to put to good use. (Thanks Alex!)</p>

<p>So I mailed a copy of the book to 15 different musicians so they could post their thoughts.  Here they are, below.  Click “LINK” to read their full post.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href="http://emarmusic.com/">Melissa Rebronja</a> for making this surprisingly-big project happen!</p>

<p>“a concise and powerful presentation of deep concepts embedded in the struggle for the development of human potential in the creative world. It also links together creativity and worldly success and makes them seem possibly attainable and not entirely contradictory.”

<p>“I've heard it said, ‘the best way to be original is to be yourself’. This is a saying that stuck with me, and throughout my life and especially as a creative person, I have done my best to live this way.  Still, every so often I, like most of us, am guilty of losing sight of this simple truth.  Hugh drives this point home time and time again in his book, and I appreciate him doing so.”

<h4><a href="http://raveonstudio.com/">Jenn Ashton, of Rave On Studio:</a></h4>
<p>“To start off, Hugh says: ‘When you have a good or great idea, the people closest to you will often react negatively’. This is true in any arena, people won’t want you to change. Change is uncomfortable, and in the music industry, I guess there is a real possibility that you and your life may change if you ever let ‘fame’ get into your head.”

<p>“For me, the main thing that I took from Ignore Everybody was: Be less vulnerable.  Notice I didn’t say don’t be vulnerable -- I don’t think you could be an artist (musician, painter, writer, whatever) if you weren’t vulnerable to some degree”

<h4><a href="http://www.euphonicsound.com">James Pew, from the Euphonic Sound:</a></h4>
<p>“I read Ignore Everybody in one sitting the day I received it. For a creative person, its like having your past re-read to you by someone without the emotional involvement, who has enough sense of the modern ethos and of the symptoms of the failing artistic endeavor of the common creative person.”

<p>“Hugh's basic premise is that you really don't know if your idea is any good the moment it's created.  Nobody else does either, so keep it hush-hush til you've let it rattle around inside you a while, and you've tweaked and developed it some.”

<p>“In his book ‘Ignore Everbody’, Hugh Macleod includes references to the creative person (artist in my terminology) in a broader sense which includes the creative person with a new idea to express, wether it be an idea for a business, a painting, a piece of music, a dance.”

It's fascinating how the different arts are connected to each other, and artists and creative people working in different fields, can certainly learn from each other.”

You’ll end up motivated, you’ll make changes you never wanted to make, and then you’ll be mad at me.”
