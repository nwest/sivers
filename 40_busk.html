Here's a business idea, inspired by an email from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ujjayisoundsystem">Stephen Brown</a> today.
</p><p>
Put the street musician / busking process online.  (“Busker” = “a person who entertains people for money in public places, while asking for money.”)
</p><p>
<strong>A website where videos of street musicians are collected all in one place, each with a PayPal link so anyone watching can give some money directly to that musician.</strong>
</p><p>
See a great musician playing on the street in Cuba, Argentina, Egypt, India, or anywhere else?  Make the best recording you can with a video camera.
</p><p>
When they take a break, find out if they have a website and a PayPal address.  If so, write it down.  If not, set them up with one.  (If they don't have email, set them up an email account first, then a PayPal account pointing to that email account, etc.  Write down the info for them.  Even if they can't access it yet, they will some day.)
</p><p>
Then, with their permission, upload the video to YouTube with their name, exact location, and email in the metadata.
</p><p>
Then go to this website and make a page for them.  It only needs to ask a few things:
</p><ul>
<li>Performer's name</li>
<li>Email address (linked to PayPal)</li>
<li>Exact location and date of performance</li>
<li>URLs where videos and photos can be found</li>
<li>Optional: text box for any other info you want to add</li>
</ul><p>
The site will automatically display the videos, and make a PayPal donate button that goes to the musician's account.
</p><p>
Anything to add or change to this idea?  Brainstorm in the <a href="http://sivers.org/busk#comments">comments, here</a>.  Click any commenter's name to go to their website to contact them directly, if you want to get involved and make this happen.
