<title>Anything You Want (my first book) </title>







<p>
For years, when people asked if I'd write a book, I said no.
</p>
<p>
But when my hero <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> asked if I'd write a book for <a href="http://www.thedominoproject.com/about">his new publishing company</a>, I said <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah">HELL YEAH!!</a>
</p>
<p>
So, my first book is released today.
</p>
<p>
It's called “<a href="http://sivers.org/a"><strong>Anything You Want</strong> - 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur</a>”.
</p>
<p>
It's <strong>40 short stories, sharing what I learned during starting, building, and selling CD Baby.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not an autobiography, it's really <strong>my top-40 tips for anyone starting or running a company.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Most of the lessons are counter-intuitive, learned from experience, and go against the usual business-book advice.
If you know my blog, you'll recognize some of the stories, but now in context.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The website for the book is <a href="http://sivers.org/a">sivers.org/a</a></strong> - with links to all the different formats on Amazon.
</p>
<p>
If you like to listen, I highly recommend the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAudiobook?id=444965897&amp;s=143441">audio version</a>.
I recorded it myself, so it has a little more personality than the written word.
</p>
<p>
No matter which format you choose, it comes with a free gift: a code to download 241 hand-picked MP3s from my top CD Baby artists.
