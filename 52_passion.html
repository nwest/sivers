A few times, I've been asked a question like, “But what if I haven't found my true passion?”
</p><p>
<strong>It's dangerous to think in terms of “passion” and “purpose” because they sound like such huge overwhelming things</strong>.
</p><p>
If you think love needs to look like “Romeo and Juliet”, you'll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly.
</p><p>
If you think you haven't found your passion yet, you're probably expecting it to be overwhelming.
</p><p>
Instead, just <strong>notice what excites you and what scares you on a small moment-to-moment level</strong>.
</p><p>
If you find yourself diving into a book about Photoshop and playing around with the program for hours, go for it!  Dive in deeper.  Maybe that's your new calling.
</p><p>
If you keep thinking about something like putting on a huge conference or being a Hollywood screenwriter and you find the idea terrifies but intrigues you, it's probably a worthy endeavor for you.
</p><p>
You grow by doing what excites you and what scares you.
</p><p>
For me, CD Baby was just a curiosity: that little hobby that kept me up until 2am every night, programming and experimenting.  It just grew from there.
