<title>You should feel pain when unclear </title>







<p>
Email blasts are the best training for being clear.
</p><p>
At my last company I had about 2 million customers.
</p><p>
When writing an email to everyone, <strong>if I wasn't perfectly clear, I'd get 20,000 confused replies</strong>, which would take my staff all week to reply back to each, costing me at least $5000 plus lost morale.
</p><p>
Even if I was very clear, but took more than a few sentences to explain something, I'd get thousands of replies from people who never read past the first few.
</p><p>
Writing that email to all customers would take me all day, carefully eliminating every unnecessary word, and reshaping every sentence to make sure it could not be misunderstood.
</p><p>
<strong>One unclear sentence? Immediate $5000 penalty.</strong> Ouch.
</p><p>
<strong>Unfortunately, people writing websites don't get this kind of feedback</strong>.
</p><p>
Instead, if they're not clear, they just get silence.  Lots of hits but no action.
</p><p>
I see new websites trying to look impressive, filling their site with hundreds of puffy unnecessary sentences.
</p><p>
I feel bad that they haven't felt the pain of trying to email that text to thousands of people, to directly see how misunderstood or ignored it is.
