<title>Highest book recommendation: Ignore Everybody </title>







<p>
It's been years since I've recommended a book to everyone I know, but this book is so perfect for those balancing creativity and business, which is almost everyone I know.  Including you.
</p><p>
It's called <a href="http://sivers.org/book/IgnoreEverybody">Ignore Everybody</a> by Hugh MacLeod.  You can read my notes at <a href="http://sivers.org/book/IgnoreEverybody">http://sivers.org/book/IgnoreEverybody</a>
</p><p>
He's a successful cartoonist who worked for 10 years as an advertising copywriter.  Read his story at <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/about/">http://gapingvoid.com/about/</a>   (Warning: he swears.)
</p><p>
He really gets and speaks to that dark struggle that artists go through: wanting to quit your day job, selling out to get successful and having it fail, or having it succeed, or not-selling-out and having it fail, or having it succeed.
</p><p>
But this is not a self-help book!  He's slightly cranky, very realistic, and can describe your situation exactly since he's been there himself, then say, “But here's what I've noticed...” - and give you an insight you'll find useful for your own career or art.
</p><p>
It's a short lean book.  Perfect for those who rarely find the time to read a whole book.
