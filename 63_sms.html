Imagine you have a crush on a girl at the bank.
</p><p>
Every time you talk, it's only business.
</p><p>
But one day she says, “Here's my cellphone number. Call anytime.”
</p><p>
Wow! She likes you!
</p><p>
You call her and ask her out. She says OK.
</p><p>
You meet up for dinner and after talking for 15 minutes she says, “Could I interest you in a home equity loan?”
</p><p>
Arrgh! That's worse than if she had never given you her number in the first place!
</p><p>
The fact that she <strong>only wants to talk about her business</strong> proves that not only is she not interested in you, but she was trying to trick you.
</p><p>
Now you're insulted and will never go to that bank again, or at least never believe it when they pretend to care about you.
</p><p>
<strong>This is what's happening with most companies' “Social Media Strategy”.</strong>
</p><p>
They're acting like they want to connect directly with you, get to know you, or hang out where you hang out.
</p><p>
But <strong>unless they learn how to stop selling, listen, and be real</strong> - they're just permanently alienating potential crushes.
