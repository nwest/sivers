It's so funny when I hear people being so protective of ideas.  (People who want me to sign an NDA to tell me the simplest idea.)
</p><p>
To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.
</p><p>
Explanation:
</p><p>
AWFUL IDEA = -1<br />
WEAK IDEA = 1<br />
SO-SO IDEA = 5<br />
GOOD IDEA = 10<br />
GREAT IDEA = 15<br />
BRILLIANT IDEA = 20
</p><p>
NO EXECUTION = $1<br />
WEAK EXECUTION = $1000<br />
SO-SO EXECUTION = $10,000<br />
GOOD EXECUTION = $100,000<br />
GREAT EXECUTION = $1,000,000<br />
BRILLIANT EXECUTION = $10,000,000
</p><p>
<strong>To make a business, you need to multiply the two.</strong>
</p><p>
The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20.<br />
</p><p>
The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $20,000,000.
</p><p>
That's why I don't want to hear people's ideas.
</p><p>
I'm not interested until I see their execution.
