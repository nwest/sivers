I answered 847 emails in 12 hours today. That's an average of 51 seconds each.  But the single most common request I got was, <strong>“Take a listen to my music and let me know what I should do.”</strong>
</p><p>
Those emails took the longest.  I never know what to do with that request.
</p><p>
Most of the time, the music is good.  Not the best or worst thing you've ever heard, but good.
</p><p>
So I could critique someone's songwriting, vocals, or production, but then what?  Would they actually go change their music just to meet my tastes?  That'd be unwise.  I'm just a musician that listens mostly to <a href="http://www.radiodarvish.com/">traditional Persian music</a> and <a href="http://somafm.com/groovesalad/played">trip-hop</a>.  I built a website that musicians use, but I was never known for my taste in music.
</p><p>
The music itself usually doesn't make it clear what someone should do.
</p><p>
What if I was in a different industry and people said:
</p><p>
“I'm trying to find a spouse. Look at my photo and tell me what I should do.”
</p><p>
or:
</p><p>
“I want to be a millionaire. Look at my bank account and tell me what I should do.”
</p><p>
The real answer is “<strong>it depends...</strong>”
</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your goals?  Why are you making music?</li>
<li>What have you done so far? What's worked? What hasn't?</li>
<li>What is your reaction to criticism or setbacks?</li>
<li>Are you <a href="http://sivers.org/time">future-focused or present-focused</a>?</li>
<li>What are your strengths and weaknesses?</li>
<li>What are your habits? Are you growing or coasting?</li>
<li>How do you measure success? Fame? Money? Emotional response?</li>
<li>What's your timeline? 1 year? 3 years? 30 years?</li>
<li>... and 50 other questions that would make this article too long.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It'd take many hours of conversation to get enough information to responsibly tell someone what to do. But since I only have a few minutes, I point people to <a href="http://sivers.org/pdf">the advice I've already written</a> and the <a href="http://sivers.org/book">books that have inspired me</a>, then hope they know how it will apply to their unique situation.
</p><p>
I always feel a little disappointed that I can't be more helpful, but that's what <a href="http://sivers.org/coaching">coaching</a> is about, so I better get that going soon.
