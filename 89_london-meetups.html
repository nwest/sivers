I'm coming to London next weekend: <strong>Saturday 18 July and Sunday 19 July</strong> 2009.
</p><p>
Thanks to the brilliant comments, below, we've got two different venues for Saturday and Sunday.  Please choose just one.  (Sorry they're both west-side.  I tried to do east and west but oh well.)
</p><p>
If you can come, please click to fill out your info on one of these two pages:
</p>
<h4><a href="http://sivers.org/meet/1">Saturday, 18 July - 12 noon: Troubador - Earl's Court</a></h4>
<h4><a href="http://sivers.org/meet/2">Sunday, 19 July - 12 noon: Defectors Weld - Shepherd's Bush</a></h4>
<br /><p>
Here's some info about the meet-ups:
</p><p>
JUST CASUAL CONVERSATION: No agenda. No speech. I rarely come to London, so this is just a way for me to meet all you brilliant people I only know online, and for you brilliant people to meet eachother.
</p><p>
PLEASE COME HUNGRY.  Both of these venues are nice enough to open just for us, on the understanding that we will eat and drink!  So please come nice and hungry in return.  There is no admission cost, but you pay your own food and drink.
</p><p>
PLEASE COME SOCIAL. I'm no extrovert, but I turn it on for short bursts when needed.  Please do the same.  Introduce yourself to strangers.  Bring cards or CDs.
</p><p>
That's it!   It's important to use those links above to let me know you're coming, if you can make it.  If you can't... see you next time!
