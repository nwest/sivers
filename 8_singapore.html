In 2007, I decided I wanted to live all around the world - to remove the separations of “us” and “them”.
</p>
<p>
Move to an opposite place and live there - immersed in local friends, language, culture, and daily life - until I really understand that point of view - until it feels like home.
Then I’ll move to another opposite part of the world and do it again, until there are no more opposites left.
</p>
<p>
This will take 50 years, but I can do it, and it’s worth doing.
</p>
<p>
In 2009 I met Saj, and fell head-over-heels.
</p>
<p>
So on our second date I told her my plan and asked, “How would you feel about living in the rest of the world for the rest of your life?”
</p>
<p>
She’s an <a href="http://lucid.pro/">educational writer</a>, writing English books for K-12 students around the world.
She can do this from anywhere.
So she thought a bit, and said, “Hmmmm... Yeah.  I could do that.”
</p>
<p>
A year later, <a href="http://sivers.org/married">we got married</a>.
Two days after the wedding, we took one carry-on bag each, and went around the world, looking for a new country to call <a href="http://sivers.org/homeless">home</a>.
</p>
<p>
We went down to Brazil, up to Sweden, around Europe, over to India and China.
I kind of wanted to move to India, but she’s from there, so it failed the “opposite point of view” test for her.
I kind of wanted to move to China, but she felt it was maybe too opposite for a first step.
And then we found <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Singapore">Singapore</a>.
</p>
<p>
Singapore is 3 hours from India, 3 hours from China, on the border of Indonesia and Malaysia, so a wonderful hub for this entire part of the world.
</p>
<p>
On our first visit, we met so many amazing people from <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/aboutus/">NUS</a>, <a href="http://unbox.com.sg/about_unbox.html">Unbox</a>, <a href="http://hackerspace.sg/">Hackerspace</a>, <a href="http://e27.sg/">e27</a>, <a href="http://www.edb.gov.sg/edb/sg/en_uk/index/why_singapore.html">EDB</a>, and <a href="http://mba.insead.edu/campuses/asia_campus.cfm">INSEAD</a>.
</p>
<p>
Though there are 5 million people here, the music and entrepreneur scenes are quite small, so it feels like a small town in a big city, with the advantages of both.
It’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_Doing_Business_Index">great place to set up a business</a>, which is important to me.
It’s an amazing travel hub, with <a href="http://www.tigerairways.com/sg/en/real_deals.php">cheap flights</a> to 13 countries for under $200 - so it’s a great home base to get to know Asia.
</p>
<p>
I could go on and on about how much I love Singapore, but if you want a quick overview, the Discovery Channel did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O12Lwol3iaY">a great documentary about it</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Wikipedia page</a> is good.
</p>
<p>
We made some really dear friends on our first visit, and decided it was home.
After 8 months of waiting for the paperwork to process, <strong>we became official residents of Singapore yesterday</strong>.
</p>
<p>
We rented <a href="http://vimeo.com/23065095">an apartment</a>.
We got a <a href="http://lovekuchingproject.blogspot.com/2011/03/lana-went-to-her-forever-home-on-monday.html">kitten</a>.
I set up my <a href="http://nownownow.com/">new</a> <a href="http://50pop.com/">companies</a> here.
I’m an “entrepreneur in residence” at <a href="http://www.insead.edu/home/">INSEAD</a>, and mentoring at <a href="http://www.beta.sg/">Beta</a>.
And I’m back to work.
</p>
<p>
So now you know where to find me.
